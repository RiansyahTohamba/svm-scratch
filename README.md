# svm-scratch
SVM from scratch

# keyword
1. SVM Linear model: weight
2. hyperplane was 'linear decision boundary' that separate the the data.
3. loss function: hinge loss
4. Regularization: maximize loss function or not?
5. Gradients

# steps
initialize weights
make sure y Element_of {-1,1}
apply update rules for n_iters

# prediction
calculate 
y = sign(w*x - b)

b = bias
w = weight
x = input
